# BeatBox Musical Playlist â€” Linked List

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **linked list data structure** using the concept of a **musical playlist**.  
Each song in the playlist is treated as a node in the linked list, allowing visualization of operations such as **insertion, deletion, and traversal**.

## Objectives
- To understand how linked lists work in practice.
- To provide a visual and interactive representation of linked list operations.
- To create a user-friendly interface for educational purposes.

## Features
- Add songs at the end of the list.
- Insert a song before or after another song.
- Delete songs dynamically.
- Play next song (traverse through nodes).
- Visual diagram of the linked list.
- Step-by-step explanation of operations.
- Syntax/code display for each operation.

## Technology Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

## How It Works
1. Each song is represented as a **node** in the linked list.
2. Operations such as insertion or deletion modify the linked list structure.
3. The updated list is shown in both **text format** and as a **linked list diagram**.
4. The "Play Next" function demonstrates traversal from one node to the next.

## Educational Importance
This project helps students:
- Learn linked list concepts interactively.
- Understand real-time implementation of abstract data structures.
- Relate technical concepts with a real-world analogy (music playlist).

## Conclusion
The BeatBox Musical Playlist is a simple yet effective tool for understanding linked lists.  
It combines visualization, interaction, and code syntax to make data structures easier to grasp.
